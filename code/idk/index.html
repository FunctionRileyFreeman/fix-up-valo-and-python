<h1>Non-Newtonian Geometry</h1>
<div id="explanation">
    <p>Non-Newtonian geometry explores geometrical concepts and spaces that do not conform to the principles of classical Euclidean geometry developed by the mathematician Euclid. These non-Newtonian geometries include fractals, hyperbolic geometry, and non-Euclidean geometry, each demonstrating unique properties and deviations from traditional geometric rules.</p>

    <h3>Example 1: Fractals</h3>
    <p>Fractals are complex geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. They are generated through recursive mathematical processes. In this example, we demonstrate a classic fractal pattern called the Sierpinski Triangle.</p>

<div class="explanation">
    <h3>Example 2: Hyperbolic Geometry</h3>
    <p>Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry that deviates from the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry. It explores spaces with negative curvature, resulting in unique geometric properties. In this example, we illustrate the Poincar√© Disk Model, a representation of hyperbolic space.</p>
</div>
<div class="explanation">
    <h3>Example 3: Non-Euclidean Geometry</h3>
    <p>Non-Euclidean geometry encompasses geometries that reject one or more of Euclid's axioms, particularly the parallel postulate. These geometries include hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry. In this example, we showcase a Pseudosphere, which demonstrates the properties of non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
