        <h2>Introduction to M-Theory</h2>
        <p>M-Theory is a theory in physics that attempts to unify various versions of superstring theory. It proposes that the fundamental constituents of reality are not zero-dimensional point particles but one-dimensional strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to different particles.</p>
        <p>M-Theory emerged in the 1990s as a result of efforts to reconcile inconsistencies between different versions of string theory. It extends the concept of strings to include higher-dimensional objects called branes, and it posits that these branes can exist in multiple dimensions.</p>

        <h2>Fundamental Concepts</h2>
        <p>M-Theory involves several fundamental concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Branes:</strong> These are extended objects in higher-dimensional space that generalize the notion of strings. Branes can have various dimensions and properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Supersymmetry:</strong> This is a theoretical framework that introduces a symmetry between fermions (particles with half-integer spin) and bosons (particles with integer spin).</li>
            <li><strong>Extra Dimensions:</strong> M-Theory proposes the existence of extra spatial dimensions beyond the three dimensions of space we perceive.</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="dimensions" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Extra Dimensions</h2>
        <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of M-Theory is the notion of extra dimensions. While we experience three spatial dimensions (length, width, and height) and one time dimension in our everyday lives, M-Theory suggests that there may be additional spatial dimensions beyond our perception.</p>
        <p>These extra dimensions are often compactified or curled up at scales much smaller than those observable in everyday life. They play a crucial role in the dynamics of string theory and can manifest in various ways, influencing the behavior of particles and forces.</p>

        <h2>Current Research</h2>
        <p>M-Theory remains an active area of research in theoretical physics. Scientists continue to explore its implications for fundamental physics and its potential connections to experimental observations.</p>
        <p>Current research topics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exploring the consequences of M-Theory for particle physics and cosmology.</li>
            <li>Investigating the mathematical structure of M-Theory and its relationship to other branches of mathematics.</li>
            <li>Studying the role of branes and extra dimensions in the context of black hole physics and quantum gravity.</li>
