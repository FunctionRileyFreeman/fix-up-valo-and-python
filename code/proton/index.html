    <h2>Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons</h2>
    <p>
        Protons, neutrons, and electrons are the three primary subatomic particles that make up atoms.

        <h3>Protons</h3>
        <p>
            Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a relative mass of 1 and a charge of +1. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number, which in turn defines the element. For example, hydrogen has one proton, carbon has six, and oxygen has eight.

        <h3>Neutrons</h3>
        <p>
            Neutrons are neutral particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They have a relative mass of 1 but no charge. Neutrons help stabilize the nucleus by counteracting the repulsive forces between positively charged protons. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="particle-info">
        <h3>Electrons</h3>
        <p>
            Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom in specific energy levels or shells. They have a negligible mass compared to protons and neutrons and have a charge of -1. The number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, ensuring that the atom is electrically neutral. Electrons are involved in chemical bonding and determine the chemical properties of an element.
